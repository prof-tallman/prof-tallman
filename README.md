- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @prof-tallman and I teach computer science at Concordia University Irvine. I teach classes that have interesting subject matter: everything from Data Structures/Algorithms and Object-Oriented Programming to Information Security (crypto) and a basic Machine Learning class.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating projects that can be used as examples and assignments for these classes. I believe that students learn best with Project Based Learning--but it can be hard to find the right projects.
